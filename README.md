# webdev-task1-4
Task 1 folder implements a fixed width page layout to 640px. minimal CSS, improvements in task2-4.

Task 2-4 folder implements the remaing tasks - improving on Task 1.  Responds responsively to viewport sizes as requested and implements accordion.

TODO: Although Task2-4 folder represents the final result, further work is needed

1. Clean up  
2. tweak CSS for more improvements, refactoring  
3. maybe more viewport size mods to improve responsive layout grid to different sizes
